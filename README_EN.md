# System-Init-Toolbox
【System Init Toolbox】A software that allows you to quickly install necessary programs such as runtime libraries after installing the system<br/>
## Note: This is the master branch, also known as the dev branch. Its content is real-time development and submission, and the availability of functions cannot be guaranteed. It can only be guaranteed to compile and run normally. If you want to modify the program, please modify it on the basis of the released version source code, and avoid modifying on the basis of this branch as much as possible. <br/>
# Download, install and run
First, welcome to the System Init Toolbox.


This program is developed using [WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)([.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) Desktop 6.0), and Use Visual Studio 2022 as editor.

If you need to use this program, we recommend that you obtain this program through Github Release (see below for details: Download the installer from Github Release)

If you want to run or modify this program by compiling, see below: How to compile and run this program

# Download the installer from Github Release
This is the method we most recommend you to use, and it is the most stable, easiest and safest method. You only need to click Releases on the right side of this project page, or just **[click here](https://github.com/Stargazing-Studio/System-Init-Toolbox/releases)** to go directly to the download page, Get download links for all versions of the program.

After the download is complete, double-click to run, and follow the prompts to install it, which is very simple and fast.

# How to compile and run this program
As said above, this program uses Visual Studio 2022 as the editor. So if you want to run this program by compiling, you first need to download and install a **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**, and make sure that "" .NET Desktop Development" and "Windows 11 22000.0 SDK" These two function options have been checked.

After successful installation, use **[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** to clone this repository to your computer.

Of course, we just recommend you to use Github Desktop. If you still just want to use vanilla Git, you can clone this repository by executing the following command:

`git clone "https://github.com/Stargazing-Studio/System-Init-Toolbox.git"`

After the clone is complete, double-click System Init Toolbox.sln should be able to open this project.

If you need to modify the program, just follow the way you usually develop WPF programs.

If it needs to be run, there should be a green run button at the top of the main Visual Studio window, click to compile and run. The compiled program is generally stored in the bin folder, and you can copy it to run on other computers, or publish it as your own program under the premise of abiding by the open source agreement of this program. Of course, the program compiled by this compilation method does not have a framework, and the user must install the .NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime when running. If you want to compile a program with a framework...~ No, no, no, how can I start teaching you how to use Visual Studio? Shouldn't you go to Baidu yourself in this situation?~
